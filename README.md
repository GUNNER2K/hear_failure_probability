# hear_failure_probability

This project is based on predicting the probability of a person getting a heart attack on the baasis of the kaggle dataset provided above as "heart.csv" .
this is end to end project , so this model is exported and a local server is generated with the help of flask to make a basic web app.
<h3>Some insights of the code</h3>

- Male vs female count in the dataset

  As seen the dataset seems to be imbalanced , so our model tends to be more biased towards male patient.
